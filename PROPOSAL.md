# Project Proposal
### Password manager
#### Description and Motivation
In this project, we want to build a password manager. We'd like for our password manager to store the user's usernames, passwords, and emails. We don't intend to encrypt the passwords when they are saved, but if we have time we will.
# Prior Art
A lot of password managers exist, but they are all on a network and someone may try to steal them. We want to make this one on the physical computer so people online can't steal them.
# Core User Workflows 

-Save Function: We would like for the program to save the user's input for their information.

-Chnge Function:  We would like the program to be able to change a save username, password, or email.

-View Function:  We would like the program to be able to show the user their information of the ask for it.
# Daily Goals
## Tuesday 
We would like to get the basic format for the welcome and which option the user would like to do. By th end of the day, the user should be able to select out of the three options: view, change, and save passwords. 
## Wednesday 
We would like the user to be able to add and save passwords within a list. 
## Thursday 
We would like for the user to be able to veiw/change passwords. Also, when they close the program for it to save the passwords.
